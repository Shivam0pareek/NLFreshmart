It breaks down core revenue components, analyses customer and employee behavior, and evaluates regional sales performance. The objective is to provide actionable recommendations that help FreshMart boost revenue through smarter retail decisions.

- Which product categories and features drive the most revenue.
- How different customer segments behave.
- How employee performance affects store-level sales.
- Which cities and countries outperform or underperform.
- How discounts influence customer buying decisions.
- Time-based sales trends.
